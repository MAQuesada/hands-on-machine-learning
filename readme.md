# On the way to data science

Practical collection of Jupyiter notebooks developed by me when reading the book **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow** by Aurélien Géron. Excellent book, it was very helpful to me, especially in `Deep Learning`.

The name os the book speak for itself, it covers the use of the main libraries that a data scientist should know.
